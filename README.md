15.08.2022: Revise what was learned.
1. let, var, const:
Let vs Var: Scope of a var is the entire enclosing function, while let have their scope in the block for which they declared
Unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.
Const: cant change the value, but can manipulate the indexes inside the array.

2. Data types:
Primitive values (immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language)
    Boolean type (true false)
    Null type (intentional absence - falsy for boolean operations)
    Undefined type (a valuable that has not been assigned any values or to formal arguments for which there's no actual arguments)
    Number type
    BigInt type
    String type
    Symbol type
Objects (collections of properties)
